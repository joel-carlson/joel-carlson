# Hi there 👋, I’m Joel Carlson
**I'm a masters student at CU Boulder study all there is to know about AI and ML.**


**🔭 I’m currently working on:**  
- Evaluating the Segment Anything Model (SAM 2.1) vs. U-Net on the DeepGlobe Satellite Image Understanding Challenge [DeepGlobe-2-Transformers](https://github.com/joel-carlson/DeepGlobe-2-Transformers)
- Performing image segmentation on highly detailed drone images of snowpack for [RMBL](https://www.rmbl.org/). 


**🌱 I’m learning:**  
-  Advanced vision transformers (Swin, SegFormer, etc.)  
-  Self-supervised representation learning for remote sensing
